# WalkingToursApp
SoleSearcher - a Walking Tour Plateform

SoleSearcher is my Iron Yard Final Project. Iâ€™ve created this app to be a platform for taking and creating walking tours for friends, family and travelers to get to know your city from your perspective. You have the opportunity to create walking routes to show off cool destinations and sights which the world should see.

v1.0 - app is on the app store!

v1.1 - made saving more efficent, added a popover box for walking tour stop information.

v1.2 - added the ability to make tours public or private, and to test private tours when logged in

v1.3 - hoping to create a method to share private tours between users
